Thanks for your interest!

Were looking for a small starting cohort of users to help label, identify taxonomy issues, and offer ideas for new data sets. 

Are you a film maker, an editor, student, ai researcher, media ethicist, developer, or just curious? 

We want to work closely with folks interested in Synopsis and making the tools, models and data sets more useful to more people. 

Please note, our labeling data does represent international film from all eras, and all genres. There may be some nudity, violence, gore, or otherwise questionable material.

Please note were looking on ways of not just making our models better, but the process of making our models better. Your input is invaluable.
