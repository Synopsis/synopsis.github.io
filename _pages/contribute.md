There are many ways to contribute to the Synopsis project.

First, you can use it and provide feedback, report bugs, and suggest improvements on our [github](http://github.com/synopsis). You can [join our slack channel](https://join.slack.com/t/synopsis-discuss/shared_invite/enQtODIzNjg5MzA1MDYwLTg4OGM5ZGMzZTQ3OTBjYTQzZDMyNDY0ZWM3NzFkN2YxZTE5NWI5NWQyMmZjMGE1OGYyZmExMWFlZWVkMDE4ZWQ) and participate.

Secondly, you can join our [crowd source data labeling project](https://synopsis.video/crowdsource/)- suggest new data sources, more diverse concepts, and help label existing and new data to make Synopsis better, less biased, and learn more, and be more useful to everyone.

Finally, you can donate via Github Sponors, to help financially support the project. Open Source, while free, is expensive to develop and maintain.
