# Label Groups / Taxonomy

CinemaNet is inspired by the language of the art of cinema. Terminology from screen writing, cinematography and photography, editing, and visual composition inform the taxonomy. Currently 14 conceptual groups with over 200 concepts in total make up prediction classes our model.

The taxonomy currently consists of:

# Bias in cinema

The history of film is long, and often troublesome. Issues of respresentation, who gets leading roles, and shifting cultural norms are hugely problematic for historical data sets like ours. Because older films contain now outdated "norms" (racism, sexism, cultural sterotyping - the list goes on and on) - our data set will inherently contain these biases - and any models trained on them if not carefully reviewed may contain them as well. 

*Thats a problem for any software that uses these models*.

Help us address these issues by participating in our crowd sourced labeling project - and suggest new concepts, help provide  or over-looked tags.If you are interested in contributing - please check out our slack channel. We need your help! A diverse community of contributors is key to identifying problems and solutions.

# Pretained Models

CinemaNet provides pre-trained models outside of just the SDK. If you are looking to target other platforms, or want to build custom solutions, our models suitable for realtime usage even on mobile. 

Using Googles industry standard MobileNetV2 neural network architecture, we provide models in CoreML (.mlmodel), Keras (.h5), Tensorflow (.pb) formats as well as JSON.
